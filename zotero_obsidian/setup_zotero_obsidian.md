# Linking Zotero and Obsidian

This is a guide for getting Obsidian and Zotero to work together.

## Zotero plugins

To download any of these plugins, refer to the script I have set up. Then, install the plugin into Zotero (Tools, Add-ons, Install Add-on From File...).

* [Better Bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/). This plugin is used used for generating unique citation keys to be able to uniquely reference and find any research paper.
* [Mdnotes](https://argentinaos.com/zotero-mdnotes/). This plugin intelligently exports Zotero metadata, notes, and annotations as markdown files which we can then integrate into Obsidian.
* [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/). This plugin manages the attachments of a specific source. Specifically, it allows for the automatic renaming, moving, and attaching of PDFs (or other files) to Zotero items. It is also useful for syncing PDFs from your Zotero library to your (mobile) PDF reader (e.g. an iPad, Android tablet, etc.).

## Obsidian plugins

Installing plugins for Obsidian is done through their interface, and it is pretty easy and straightforward.

* [Zotero Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration). This is the newer plugin and seems like the one I should be using. It allows for links to be clicked on within Obsidian and the corresponding paper or note should open up in Zotero.
* [Dataview][https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/]. This turns your Obsidian vault into a database which you can run queries on.
* [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count). This is a nice little plugin which improves upon the built-in word counter from Obsidian. The thing I like most about it is that it allows for tracking of other items other than words and characters (e.g., sentences). It also will dynamically update to keep track of the number of characters/words of highlighted sections.
* [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin). This is a great plugin for creating custom drawings as well as entire canvases.

## Settings

The most laborious part of the setup is tweaking the settings in Zotero and Obsidian to get the exact right behavior I would like. Below, I will detail as best as I can the settings I have changed from the defaults to get the behaviors I like.

### Zotero settings

### Obsidian settings

### Mdnotes Template files

* The template files for mdnotes are included in this directory. These template files need to be pointed to within the Mdfiles settings within Zotero. This ensures that notes and papers are properly imported into Obsidian.
