# Setting up your Python environment on Linux systems

It can seem intimidating at first when it comes to setting up your Python environment on a Linux system. Should I use the system version of Python that already comes installed? What's `virtualenv` and how is it different from `venv` and how are **they** different from `pyenv`? Should I use my operating system package manager (e.g. `apt` and `yum`) or `pip` to handle all my Python packages? All these things and more I shall go over in this article.

Note the specific commands I'll be going over are for Ubuntu 18.04, but the principles apply broadly to all Linux systems.
