# Some notes on installing R

This may be a case of me having not run into this issue yet so I'm blissfully naive about the prospects of me running into this issue. I figure it should be an easy enough issue to fix should it ever arise.

The issue being that `install_r.sh` installs and maintains one version of R. If my version of R is updated, and it breaks my code, then I'm out of luck. Thankfully there are easy ways of installing multiple versions of R to remedy this situation.
